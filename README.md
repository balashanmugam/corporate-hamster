# Corporate Hamster

This is a game made for the Ludum Dare 44 by a small team.

### Theme
The main theme of the Ludum Dare 44 was ***Life as a Currency***.

So we decided to make a infinite runner, where the player runs in a circle of despair. The player 
should avoid collecting credit card bills, mortgages and other stuff that cost money. The player can pick up vacations and cash.
